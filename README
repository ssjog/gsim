THE GRAVITATIONAL N-BODY PROBLEM

1. AUTHORS

Tobias Eriksson <tobier@kth.se>
Sebastian Sj√∂gren <ssjog@kth.se>

2. BUILDING
There are four (4) programs in seperate directiories, all including Makefiles for easy building.
To build a specific program, change into the directory and type 'make', and 'make clean' to clean up.
All programs have an illustrative graphical simulation. To build a program with graphics, type 'make gfx'.
Please note that the graphical simulations require SDL and OpenGL libraries to be installed on the system.

All programs, with and without graphics, have been successfully built on Ubuntu Linux.

3. RUNNING
Each program requires different command-line arguments. RUn the program without any
command-line arguments: the program will print how to properly use it.

4. REPORT
The report is included as a PDF file, named 'report.pdf'.
